# Amazon Customer Analysis

## Project Description

This project explores Amazon customer data to uncover insights about customer behavior, sentiment, and product preferences on the e-commerce platform. The objective is to better understand how customers interact with products and provide actionable insights into purchasing and reviewing patterns.

## Who Will Benefit and Why

E-commerce analysts, marketing teams, and product managers will benefit from this analysis. It offers a clearer picture of customer preferences, product popularity, and reviewer behavior, helping these stakeholders make informed decisions about inventory, marketing strategies, and customer engagement.

## Dataset Information

The dataset originates from a Udemy Data Analytics course and includes user information, product details, reviews, and ratings related to Amazon purchases.

## How It Was Done

Using Python's Pandas library, the raw data was structured into a DataFrame for systematic exploration. Various visualizations such as bar plots and box plots were created to examine:

* Product rating distributions
* User purchase frequency
* Concentration of purchases on specific products
* Differences in review patterns between frequent and infrequent buyers
* Length of reviews comparing different customer segments

## Key Findings

**What are the most popular products and their ratings?**

* Most products receive predominantly 5-star ratings.
* Top-rated items show consistent positive feedback across customers.

**How do frequent buyers differ from others?**

* Frequent buyers exhibit a more balanced rating pattern, with fewer extreme ratings (very high or very low).
* This suggests frequent reviewers tend to provide more thoughtful and moderate feedback.

**Which products dominate purchase activity?**

* A small group of products accounts for a high frequency of purchases, highlighting Amazonâ€™s best-sellers.

**Are there differences in review behavior between frequent and infrequent customers?**

* Frequent buyers write reviews that tend to be more moderate in sentiment.
* Box plots reveal that review lengths vary, with frequent buyers tending to write longer, more detailed reviews.

## Conclusion

The analysis reveals clear distinctions between frequent and non-frequent buyers in terms of rating behavior and review detail. Popular products maintain strong positive feedback, underscoring consistent customer satisfaction. Understanding these patterns provides valuable insights into customer engagement on Amazon.

## Recommendations

Future analyses could benefit from incorporating temporal data to track trends over time and adding user demographics to enrich understanding of customer segments. Improving dataset completeness and capturing dynamic rating changes would also enhance the accuracy and depth of insights.
